### Understanding UI folder Structure.

(The project follows the atomic design methodology)

- **atoms**: The smallest building blocks of the UI, such as buttons, inputs, and icons.
- **molecules**: Combinations of atoms that form more complex components, like a search bar or a card. (eg. Cards, Dialog boxes, Tables etc)
- **organisms**: Groups of molecules that form distinct sections of the UI, such as a header or a footer.
- **templates/layouts**: Page-level components that define the layout and structure of a page, using organisms.
- **pages**: The highest level of components that represent complete pages, composed of templates and other components.
- **shadcn**: all the downloaded shadcn components appear here.
